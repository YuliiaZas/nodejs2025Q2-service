## Prerequisites

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Docker - [Download & Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

## Downloading

```
git clone https://github.com/YuliiaZas/nodejs2025Q2-service
```

## Change directory to the project root

```
cd nodejs2025Q2-service
```
## Change branch to `part-2`

```
git checkout part-2
```

## Environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project

```
cp .env.example .env
```

and add the following variables:

```
PORT=4000
POSTGRES_USER=...
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=...
POSTGRES_DB=...
```

## Running application

```
npm docker:up
```

After starting the app on port (4000 as default) you can open
in your browser OpenAPI documentation by typing http://localhost:4000/doc/.
For more information about OpenAPI/Swagger please visit https://swagger.io/.

## Docker volumes

The application uses Docker volumes to persist data. The following volumes are created:
- `nodejs2025q2-service_postgres_data`: This volume is used to store the PostgreSQL database data.
- `nodejs2025q2-service_logs`: This volume is used to store logs generated by the application.
- `nodejs2025q2-service_postgres_data`: This volume has purpose to avoid conflicts with the local `node_modules` directory.

To check the volumes, you can run the following command:

```
docker volume ls
```

## Generating OpenAPI documentation
To generate OpenAPI documentation, run the following command:

```
npm run generate:doc
```
This will create a `doc/api.yaml` file containing the OpenAPI documentation.

## Testing

After application running open new terminal and enter:

To run all tests without authorization:
- inside the Docker container:
```
docker compose exec app npm run test
```

- or from the host machine (previously you need to run `npm install` and `npm start` or `npm docker:up`):
```
npm run test
```

To run only one of all test suites
- inside the Docker container:
```
docker compose exec app npm run test -- <path to suite>
```

- or from the host machine (previously you need to run `npm install` and `npm start` or `npm docker:up`):
```
npm run test -- <path to suite>
```
