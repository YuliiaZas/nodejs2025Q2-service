## Downloading

```
git clone https://github.com/YuliiaZas/nodejs2025Q2-service
```

## Change directory to the project root

```
cd nodejs2025Q2-service
```
## Change branch to `part-2`

```
git checkout part-2
```

## Environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project

```
cp .env.example .env
```

and add the following variables:

```
PORT=4000
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=...
POSTGRES_USER=...
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=...
POSTGRES_HOST=...
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@${POSTGRES_HOST}:${POSTGRES_PORT}/${POSTGRES_DB}?schema=public
```

## Running application

You can run the application in two modes: development and production using Docker Compose.

After starting the app on port (4000 as default) you can open
in your browser OpenAPI documentation by typing http://localhost:4000/doc/.
For more information about OpenAPI/Swagger please visit https://swagger.io/.

### Development mode

To run the application in development mode with hot-reload, use the following command:

```
npm run docker:up
```

To stop the application and remove conteiners, network, and bolumes, use:

```
npm run docker:down
```
### Production mode

To run the application in production mode, use the following command:

```
npm run docker:up:prod
```

To stop the application and remove production conteiners, network, and bolumes, use:

```
npm run docker:down:prod
```

## Docker volumes

The application uses Docker volumes to persist data. The following volumes are created:
- `nodejs2025q2-service_postgres_data`: stores the PostgreSQL database data.
- `nodejs2025q2-service_logs`: stores logs generated by the application.
- `nodejs2025q2-service_node_modules`: prevents conflicts with local `node_modules` (is present only in `dev`mode).

To check the volumes, you can run the following command:

```
docker volume ls
```

To remove all unused Docker data:
```
npm run docker:clean
```

## Database

The application uses PostgreSQL as the database. The database is created automatically when the application starts.
To view the database content, you can run the following command:

```
npm run db:content
```


## Generating OpenAPI documentation
To generate OpenAPI documentation, run the following command:

```
npm run generate:doc
```
This will create a `doc/api.yaml` file containing the OpenAPI documentation.

## Testing

After application running open new terminal and enter:

To run all tests without authorization:
- inside the Docker container:
```
npm run test:docker
```

- or from the host machine (previously you need to run `npm install` and `npm start` or `npm docker:up`):
```
npm run test
```

To run only one of all test suites
- inside the Docker container:
```
docker compose exec app-dev npm run test -- <path to suite>
```

- or from the host machine (previously you need to run `npm install` and `npm start` or `npm docker:up`):
```
npm run test -- <path to suite>
```

### Auto-fix and format

```
npm run lint
```

```
npm run format
```
